# Rendering


The following properties determine how the active texture and / or descendant textures are rendered:

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `alpha` | Float | 1 | Opacity: 0 = transparent, 1 = opaque |
| `visible` | Boolean | true | Enable / disable rendering (visibility) |
| `color` | Hex | 0xFFFFFFFF | Color (ARGB) |
| `colorTop` | Hex | 0xFFFFFFFF | Top color of a color gradient |
| `colorBottom` | Hex | 0xFFFFFFFF | Bottom color of a color gradient |
| `colorLeft` | Hex | 0xFFFFFFFF | Left color of a color gradient (overwrites colorUl, colorBl) |
| `colorRight` | Hex | 0xFFFFFFFF | Right color of a color gradient (overwrites colorUr, colorBr) |
| `colorUl` | Hex | 0xFFFFFFFF | Top-left color of a color gradient |
| `colorUr` | Hex | 0xFFFFFFFF | Top-right color of a color gradient |
| `colorBl` | Hex | 0xFFFFFFFF | Bottom-left color of a color gradient |
| `colorBr` | Hex | 0xFFFFFFFF | Bottom-right color of a color gradient |
| `clipping` | Boolean | false | Enables clipping (only for rectangular) |
| `zIndex` | Integer | 0 | z-Index sets render priority |
| `forceZIndexContext` | Boolean | false | Enables a z-index context |
| `shader` | Object | {} | Sets a default shader |
 Sets a non-default shader




## Visibility


You can set the visibility of an element in the following ways:

* Using the `visible` property. If  the value of this property is set to 'false',  the element is not rendered (which saves performance). If an element is invisible, the off-screen elements are invisible as well, so you do not have to hide those manually to maintain a good performance.
* Using the `alpha` property, which defines the opacity of an element and its descendants. If the value of this property is set to 0 (zero), the element is not rendered.

### Alpha-based Performance Optimization

Lightning automatically optimizes rendering performance by skipping elements with very low alpha values. Elements with an effective alpha of `0.001` or less are considered invisible and are automatically excluded from:

* Rendering operations
* Mouse hit testing and interaction detection

This optimization helps improve performance by avoiding unnecessary rendering work for elements that are effectively invisible to users, while still allowing for texture loading and smooth fade-in/fade-out animations.

Note: actual alpha test is `< 0.002` to avoid floating point errors when animating to `0.001`.


## Color


You can use the `color` property to colorize the currently active texture. You can specify different *directions* and /or *corner points* to create a gradient. See the [Rectangle](../Textures/Rectangle.md) texture to see colorization in action.

## Clipping


If the `clipping` property is set to 'true', everything outside the dimensions of the clipping area is *not* rendered. (The effect is similar to `overflow:hidden` in CSS.)


Setting this property might increase the performance, as descendants outside the clipping region are detected and not rendered.


[Clipping](../../Templates/Clipping.md) is implemented using the high-performance WebGL operation `scissor`. As a consequence, clipping  does *not* work for non-rectangular areas. So, if the element is rotated (by itself or by any of its ancestors), clipping is *not* applied.

> In such situations, you can use the advanced `renderToTexture` which applies clipping as a side effect.

## Z-indexing


Similar to CSS, Lightning supports *z-indexing*, which alters the expected order in which textures are rendered.
In Lightning, a *z-index context* is created by setting:

* a non-zero `zIndex`;
* `forceZIndexContext` (often useful in combination with `zIndex `= 0);
* `renderToTexture`.

## Shader


The `shader` property affects the way in which element textures and their descendants are rendered. For example:


```
class LiveDemo extends lng.Application {
    static _template() {
        return {
            shader: {type: lng.shaders.Grayscale, amount: 0.9},
            LilLightning:{ x: 100, y: 50, src: '/Lightning/img/LngDocs_LilLightningIdle.png'},
            Header: {
                rect: true, w: window.innerWidth, h: 50, color: 0xff005500
            },
            SubLilLightning: {
                x: 400, y: 50, src: '/Lightning/img/LngDocs_LilLightningIdle.png',
                shader: null // Reset shader to default.
            },
            SubLilLightning2: {
                x: 400, y: 250, src: '/Lightning/img/LngDocs_LilLightningIdle.png',
                shader: {type: lng.shaders.Inversion} // Reset shader to other.
            }
        }
    };
}

const App = new LiveDemo({stage: {w: window.innerWidth, h: window.innerHeight, useImageWorker: false}});
document.body.appendChild(App.stage.getCanvas());
```
